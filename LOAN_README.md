This repository implements a complete machine learning workflow for predicting loan approval. It employs a Kaggle dataset of 45,000 applications featuring borrower demographics, financial metrics, credit history, and loan details. The pipeline includes data cleansing, one-hot encoding, and outlier filtering via Orange; handles model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Neural Networks; and uses stratified cross-validation and grid-search tuning. Model interpretability is achieved with SHAP, and performance is assessed via AUC, F‚ÇÅ, precision, and recall. The final report offers descriptive and predictive visualizations, business recommendations, and ethics compliance guidelines.
